# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Budget Tracker

## Challenge Details
In this challenge, we were asked to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online.

IndexedDB was used for offline functionality, a service worker and web manifest were created, and the application was deployed to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas.

## Usage
The application can be found here: https://fast-temple-66110.herokuapp.com/
